                    <br/>Here you can create Folders with Pages; each Page can be used as a type
                    <br/>of whiteboard in which you can simply click anywhere and start querying! Write
                    <br/>out your query anywhere on the board and receive a response directly from
                    <br/>Chat-GPT immediately or just write a note that is relevant to your project!

                    <br/>only include the information that you want to reference later.
