GitHub
---------------------------------------
I became much more familiar w/the basics of Github. It's quite simple (shown below)
Steps to use Github:
1) Verify you have the latest code (git pull)
2) Refactor, test, and/or implement a small portion of cohesive code (test code test)
3) Commit and push (git commit git push)
4) Repeat
