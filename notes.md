GitHub
---------------------------------------
I became much more familiar w/the basics of Github. It's quite simple (shown below)
Steps to use Github:
1) Verify you have the latest code (git pull)
2) Refactor, test, and/or implement a small portion of cohesive code (test code test)
3) Commit and push (git commit git push)
4) Repeat


Deploying a website
syntax: deployFiles.sh -k <pem key file> -h <hostname> -s <service>
You need a fairly complex file (deployFiles.sh) to deploy a website. Unsure of how this is made. It seems like the type of thing that can be auto-generated.

Extensions of your domain:
    In order to allow something like extension.yourdomain.com you need to create an A record that looks like *.yourdomain.com and then you can create any extension you want following that pattern
