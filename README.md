# gpt-notes startup

## Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been using Chat GPT while working on a project and wanted to go back and see a previous query? You may have found Chat GPT's query history search functionality to be clunky, or you may have found yourself scrolling up and down through a chat looking for an answer again. GPT-Notes allows you to create folders, sub-folders, and whiteboards to organize your Chat GPT query results. Make a folder for a project, with named whiteboards for sub-sections of the project. Within each whiteboard you can click anywhere to query Chat GPT or make your own notes in a draggable, resizeable textbox. Search sections or subsections of your folders to find past query results. Maneuver the important information where you need it and even edit Chat GPT's responses later to show only what you need.
